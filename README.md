Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is essential to develop a modern society where
smart innovations can efficiently interact with technology and the community. Human
Activity Recognition (HAR) has significantly minimized the gap between human and
computer interactions. However, the recognition task needs active user cooperation and
pre-installed system infrastructures which carries several privacy issues. Lately, wireless
fidelity (Wi-Fi) devices have successfully been leveraged to decode human body
movements due to unique fluctuations produced by Channel State Information (CSI).
Such systems need no dedicated infrastructures and usersâ€™ privacy is preserved.
Unfortunately, system tolerance to unseen users and new environments is very restricted.
System scalability is a major concern when adopting novel changes that curb their
implications in real-world scenarios. Recent research has also demonstrated that the
impact of surroundings causes dissimilar variations in the channel state information at
different times of the day. This paper proposes an unsupervised multi-source domain
adaptation technique. It utilizes the multi-source diverse data distributions and aligns
them with a target domain influenced by variations produced by new users, environs,
or/and varying atmospheric conditions. We worked with three public CSI datasets to
generate these cross-domain variations. We used a conversion module to preprocess the
CSI into images with different characteristics suitable for the datasets. Extensive
experiments show the usefulness of the proposed methodology in cross-domain HAR
applications using device-free sensing due to its remarkable results on cross-variations
most likely to be introduced in a realistic world.
